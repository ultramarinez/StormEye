| ----------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| VCC                     | 3.3V             | (+) capacitor  |
| GND                     | GND              | (−) capacitor  |
| CE                      | GPIO 22          |                |
| CSN                     | GPIO 21          |                |
| SCK                     | GPIO 18          |                |
| MOSI                    | GPIO 23          |                |
| MISO                    | GPIO 19          |                |
| IRQ                     |                  |                |



##### ❗ Notes:
- Ensure that the **10µF capacitors** are connected between the VCC and GND pins of each nRF24L01 module to stabilize the power supply.
- The **IRQ** pins are left unconnected in this configuration. If needed, you can connect them to an appropriate GPIO pin for interrupt handling.
